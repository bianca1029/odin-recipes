        <p>This simple French toast recipes makes for a quick and easy breakfast. Brioche and challah bread make the
            best French toast. Both are already so eggy that once dipped in the batter and griddled in butter they
            become custard-like on the inside. The nicely browned and caramelized outside is thanks in part to the added
            sugar in the egg mixture. And playing with the flavor is easy: This recipe has a touch of warmth from
            cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. Heres a pro tip: Make sure you dont over-soak the bread. Fully submerge it
            in the batter for only a few seconds and let any excess drip off before cooking. And wait for the bubbles
            from the melted butter to subside — thats when you know your pan is hot enough.</p>
